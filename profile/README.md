# Rust Embedded Community

The [rust-embedded-community][REC] GitHub organization serves two purposes: increasing the bus factor of hosted crates and provide a place for centralized maturation of experimental crates which are meant to be widely used.

For the official working group dedicated to [Rust] on embedded devices, please refer to the [Rust Embedded Working Group][REWG].

## Mission

### Home for projects in need of further maintenance

There are libraries that were once developed but the original author does not have the time necessary for further development or has moved on to other projects.

The REC provides a place for those of these libraries which are accepted to live on, offering the opportunity for development to be easily aided by or taken over by a group of interested people, also to increase the "bus factor".

### Centralized maturation of experimental crates

The REC provides a place for crates to mature in a centralized way. That means a centralized organization where several people can collaborate in projects that are (still) too experimental but are meant to be widely-used.

The shared ownership provided by this organization ensures that widely-used crates do not become unmaintained.

### Relation to the Rust Embedded Working Group organization

The [Rust Embedded Working Group][REWG] is an official working group of the [Rust programming language][rust]. This organization is not. This organization should be seen as separate and "non-blessed".
